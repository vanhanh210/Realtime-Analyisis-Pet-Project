## Overview
This repository contains the analysis and code for the Real-Time Analyst Project, focusing on workload analysis and predictive modeling in an operational context. The project aims to provide insights into workload patterns, forecast future work volume, and classify operational days for efficient resource management.

## Contents
- `Real-Time Analyst Project.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with all analyses and models.
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets used in the analysis (if applicable).
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages for running the notebook.

## Features
- **Workload Forecasting**: Implementation of time series forecasting models like ARIMA or SARIMA to predict future work volumes.
- **Clustering for Operational Insights**: Application of clustering techniques (like K-Means) to categorize operational days based on workload characteristics.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Use of methods like the Elbow Method for determining the optimal number of clusters.
- **Data Preprocessing and Analysis**: Comprehensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.
## Methodology
- **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of workload data to understand patterns and distributions.
- **Forecasting Model**: Development and tuning of forecasting models to predict workload.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Identification of distinct operational clusters for strategic planning.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessment of model performance and validity of insights.
