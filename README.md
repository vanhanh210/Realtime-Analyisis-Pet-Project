## Overview
This repository contains the analysis and code for the Real-Time Analyst Project, focusing on workload analysis and predictive modeling in an operational context. The project aims to provide insights into workload patterns, forecast future work volume, and classify operational days for efficient resource management.

## Here's an explanation of each metric:
- Date_Time: Timestamp indicating when the data was recorded. It's often used to track and analyze trends over time.
- Work_Volume: Represents the quantity of work handled in a given period. This could be the number of calls, tasks, or transactions.
- Schedule_Adherence_Percent: A measure of how closely employees adhere to their scheduled work times. High adherence means employees are working their scheduled hours.
- Event_Scheduling_Needed: Indicates whether there is a need for scheduling offline events or tasks. This could be binary (yes/no) or a count of such events.
- Average_Handling_Time_sec: The average time spent handling a task or call, typically measured in seconds. This is a key efficiency metric in customer service operations.
- Latency_sec: The delay before a task is started or a call is answered, measured in seconds. Lower latency is generally better for service quality.
- Utilization_Rate_Percent: The percentage of time that employees are actively engaged in work tasks as opposed to being idle. Higher utilization rates can indicate better efficiency but might also lead to employee burnout if consistently high.
- Shrinkage_Rate_Percent: Refers to the percentage of time during which employees are not available to handle tasks due to breaks, meetings, training, etc. It's important for understanding the actual availability of staff for work.
- Attendance_Rate_Percent: The rate at which staff are present compared to the number scheduled. This metric is crucial for workforce planning and understanding staffing levels.
- Overstaffing_Indicator: A flag or measure indicating whether there was more staff available than needed. This can be used to identify inefficiencies in staffing.
- Understaffing_Indicator: Similar to the above but indicates situations where there were fewer staff than needed, which can impact service levels and employee workload.
- Service_Level_Compliance_Percent: A measure of how well service level targets (like response time goals) are being met. High compliance percentages indicate good performance against set targets.
