## Overview
This repository contains the analysis and code for the Real-Time Analyst Project, focusing on workload analysis and predictive modeling in an operational context. The project aims to provide insights into workload patterns, forecast future work volume, and classify operational days for efficient resource management.

## Here's an explanation of each metric:

| Metric                           | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `Date_Time`                      | Timestamp indicating when the data was recorded, used to track and analyze trends over time. |
| `Work_Volume`                    | Represents the quantity of work handled in a given period, such as the number of calls, tasks, or transactions. |
| `Schedule_Adherence_Percent`     | Measures how closely employees adhere to their scheduled work times. High adherence indicates employees are working as scheduled. |
| `Event_Scheduling_Needed`        | Indicates the need for scheduling offline events or tasks, which could be binary (yes/no) or a count. |
| `Average_Handling_Time_sec`      | The average time spent on handling a task or call, typically in seconds. It's a key metric for efficiency. |
| `Latency_sec`                    | The delay before starting a task or answering a call, measured in seconds. Lower latency is usually better. |
| `Utilization_Rate_Percent`       | The percentage of time that employees are actively engaged in work tasks. Higher rates indicate efficiency but may also lead to burnout. |
| `Shrinkage_Rate_Percent`         | The percentage of time when employees are unavailable for work tasks due to breaks, meetings, training, etc. |
| `Attendance_Rate_Percent`        | The rate at which staff are present compared to the number scheduled. Important for workforce planning. |
| `Overstaffing_Indicator`         | A measure indicating whether there was more staff than needed, identifying potential staffing inefficiencies. |
| `Understaffing_Indicator`        | Indicates situations where there were fewer staff than needed, affecting service levels and workload. |
| `Service_Level_Compliance_Percent` | Measures the compliance with service level targets like response time goals. High percentages indicate good performance. |
